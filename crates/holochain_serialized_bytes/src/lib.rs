/// Two main reasons this was done rather than the normal Derive approach:
/// - Derive requires a separate crate
/// - Derive doesn't allow for use of $crate to set unambiguous fully qualified paths to things
///
/// Both of these limitations push dependency management downstream to consumer crates more than we
/// want to.
/// This implementation allows us to manage all dependencies explicitly right here in this crate.
///
/// There is a default implementation of SerializedBytes into and out of ()
/// this is the ONLY supported direct primitive round-trip, which maps to `nil` in messagepack
/// for all other primitives, wrap them in a new type or enum
///
/// e.g. do NOT do this:
/// `u32::try_from(serialized_bytes)?;`
///
/// instead do this:
/// ```
/// use holochain_serialized_bytes::prelude::*;
///
/// #[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
/// pub struct SomeType(u32);
/// holochain_serial!(SomeType);
/// let serialized_bytes = SerializedBytes::try_from(SomeType(50)).unwrap();
/// let some_type = SomeType::try_from(serialized_bytes).unwrap();
/// ```
///
/// put `SomeType` in a separate crate that can be shared by all producers and consumers of the
/// serialized bytes in a minimal way.
/// this is a bit more upfront work but it's the only way the compiler can check a type maps to
/// a specific serialization across different systems, crate versions, and refactors.
///
/// for example, say we changed `SomeType(u32)` to `SomeType(u64)` in the shared crate
/// with the new type the compiler can enforce roundtripping of bytes works everywhere `SomeType`
/// is used, provided all producers and consumers use the same version of the shared crate.
/// in the case where we have no `SomeType` and would use integers directly, there is no safety.
/// the system can't tell the difference between a type mismatch (e.g. you just wrote u32 in the
/// wrong spot in one of the systems) and a serialization mismatch (e.g. the serialized bytes
/// produced by some system were consumed by another system using a different version of the shared
/// crate or something).
///
/// Developers then have to manually mentally impose the meaning of primitives over the top of code
/// across different code-bases that are ostensibly separate projects.
/// This introduces the effect where you can't understand/refactor one component of the system
/// without understanding and refactoring all the other components in the same PR/QA step.
///
/// An explicit goal of SerializedBytes is to introduce stability of byte-level data interfaces
/// across systems, provided they share the same version of a shared types crate.
/// This means that that one component can implement a new version of the shared types and know
/// that it will be compatible with other components when they similarly upgrade AND other
/// components are safe to delay upgrading to the latest version of the shared crate until they are
/// ready to move. Essentially it allows for async development workflows around serialized data.
///
/// This is especially important for wasm as the wasm hosts and guests may not even be developed
/// by the same people/organisations, so there MUST be some compiler level guarantee that at least
/// the shared types within the same shared crate version have compatible serialization logic.
///
/// usually when working with primitives we are within a single system, i.e. a single compilation
/// context, a single set of dependencies, a single release/QA lifecycle
/// in this case, while we _could_ wrap every single primitive in a new type for maximum compile
/// time safety it is often 'overkill' and we can eat some ambiguity for the sake of ergonomics and
/// minimising the number of parallel types/trait implementations.
/// in the case of parallel, decoupled, independently maintiained systems that rely on byte-level
/// canonical representation of things that will fail (e.g. cryptographically break or (de)allocate
/// memory incorrectly) if even one byte is wrong, the guide-rails provided by new types and enums
/// are worth the additional up-front effort of creating a few extra shared crates/types.
